##Travel and Tourism##
In travel and tourism, some of the highest paying sectors in the world, Artifical intelligence can be used to optimise the sector and formulate a better overall
experience for not only the travellers and clients, yet the sector and corporate as a whole due to the nature and application that artifical intelligence can be used for.
For instance, consider the implications of travel in safety, particularly during the screening process. If AI is used to its potential, not only does screening become 
much more potent for the sake of preventing illegal objects and potential attacks, yet it greatly speeds up the process and allows for scanning times to be much more 
efficient, creating an overall greater and safer experience in the process. Further to this, not only would it greatly help airports in handling traffic, yet for Tourism,
AI would be able to identify the best tourist destinations and cater towards every passenger and locate the optimal destinations for them to vacation on, thus generating
more revenue for the industry by increasing the volume of tourists and thereby expanding the industry. However, there are extreme limitations as of 2022 that will need to 
be resolved if there is any hope of seamlessy integrating AI in the process and generating the results that are so desired. For instance, the development of AI is 
extremely costly, which may drive up prices and stifle investment for the timebeing. Secondly, due to the high cost of AI, it proves extremely difficult to implement 
certain technologies across the entire industry, especially considering the global nature, economic differences and variety in every countries ability to invest. Not to 
mention, the use of AI will also have a negative impact on the job industry, due to no longer needing people such as TSA screener agents, and travel advisors, for AI 
would automate the processes and render the travel agent unecessary and expensive, thus causing many people to be without a job.
